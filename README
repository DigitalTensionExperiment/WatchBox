# <under construction>

kernel modules: lsmod

device files: /dev
- block, character, directory

libraries:
- libc
- glibc

static libraries <> header files
** Binary programs include static libraries which make them bigger;

dynamic libraries - more efficient b/c they live as files on disk;
# ldd $(...)

Application doesn't have to know where to find shared libraries: ld.so.conf
(helper program that reads default progrms)
For those not in default: ld.so.conf
Anything that's not standard: put the name of the directory right here;
After modifications, run this to update the library cache:
# ldconfig -v

[Kali]
In Kali, ld.so.conf is not a file, but a directory;
It contains libc.donf ;

- /usr/lib/systemd/ has no system directory;

Daemon processes have no stdIn;

ARP is the protocol that translates from IP to MAC address;
Run this to check to see the right MAC address to the right IP:
# arp -a
